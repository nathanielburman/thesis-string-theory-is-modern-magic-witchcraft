# thesis-string-theory-is-modern-magic-witchcraft
The people who work in String Theory are witches. They are not being honest about what all the formulas and dimensions and math does. They are lying. They are liars.

The fomulas and math, it keeps being said by our best scientists, they say that String Theory, while nice and really fancy and really really special, doesnt do anything.

How in the hell, in a Democracy hell, does that department operate for more than 40 years "doing nothing"?

Witchcraft and Magic.

I know you say whatever, but the deal is this, you are telling me that you have 50+ years of science about the Strings and you got nothing to show for it? Interesting. Nothing to show... get it.

Theres nothing to show because its magic!

Someone is NOT being honest about the Strings Theories trying to solve all kinds of problems. This is solving problems for someone somewhere. Just not for humans. Humans are working on this String Theory project for someone else. They are invisible.
